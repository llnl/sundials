**Major Features**

**New Features and Enhancements**

Added the function :c:func:`SUNLogger_SetQueueAndFlushMsgFns` to allow for
user-defined functions to queue and flush log messages.

Updated ``examples/cvode/petsc/cv_petsc_ex7.c`` to support PETSc 3.25.0.

**Bug Fixes**

Fixed memory leaks in CVODES, IDAS, and KINSOL in the unlikely event of a failed
``malloc``.

Fixed minor bug in reporting the maximum number of stages in
:c:func:`ARKodeGetStageIndex` when running SSP methods in LSRKStep.

Removed duplicate logging output that would cause the Python logging tools to fail
with a repeated key error.

Fixed a bug where IDAS would incorrectly compute the quadrature predictor when
IDACalcIC was used. In some cases, the lead to an inconsistent solution in the
forward solve compared to the forward recomputation from a checkpoint,
ultimately causing a segfault.
