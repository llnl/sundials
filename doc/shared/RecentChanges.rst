**Major Features**

**New Features and Enhancements**

Added the utility function, :c:func:`SUNFileFlush` for flushing file
pointers. This is useful when using the Fortran 2003 interfaces.

Added support to compute internal difference-quotient approximations to sparse
Jacobians (CSC format only) for all SUNDIALS packages.

**Bug Fixes**

Fixed a segfault that could occur when handling errors without a ``SUNContext``
provided.

Fixed a bug in ``FindMAGMA.cmake`` which didn't allow use of MAGMA versions with 
multiple digits in an identifier.

Fixed a bug in the LSRKStep module where the step post-processing function for
the RKL step was called with an incorrect time argument.
